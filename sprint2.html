    <p>For Sprint 2, our group focused on the idea of taking breaks and being more aware while spending time online. We wanted to create something that helps people slow down and be more present during their web experience.
This sprint was a big learning curve for me. I spent a lot of time figuring out how HTML and CSS work together, and how to add JavaScript into the mix. There were a lot of moments where things didn’t work at all, and it got frustrating. But every time I finally got something to work, it felt amazing—like a little celebration.
For my first project, I made a circle that gets bigger and smaller to help guide people’s breathing. The idea was to have a calming visual they could sync their breath with. After that, I worked on a project where every time you click, a circle appears on the screen and slowly blocks more of it. After 20 clicks, the screen is totally covered and it’s time to take a break. I thought it was a fun way to make people pause after spending too much time clicking around.
As a group, we did some live coding together and shared ideas, which really helped. It was cool to see how everyone approached things differently, and we learned a lot from each other.
What worked well for me was just taking things step by step and not giving up when things got tricky. It also helped to ask questions and talk through problems with my group. If I could do anything differently next time, I’d try to spend more time on making the project look better visually. I think that would help make it even more effective. I also wish we had a bit more time—coding takes a lot of trial and error, especially when you're just getting the hang of it.
Overall, I’m proud of what I made and how much I’ve learned. I’m excited to keep experimenting and see how far I can take these ideas.
